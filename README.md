# TO-DO-LIST
This is a console-based To-Do List application written in C++, designed to demonstrate Data Structures and Algorithms concepts. The project uses a singly linked list to manage tasks dynamically and supports basic CRUD operations.

It is ideal for DSA practice, OOP understanding, and university assignments.

**Features**

1.Add new tasks

2.Update existing tasks

3Delete tasks

4.Display all tasks

5.Menu-driven interface

**Data Structure**

1.Singly Linked List

2.Dynamic memory allocation

3.Efficient insertion and deletion

**Concepts Used**

Structures

1.Classes and Objects

2.Pointers

3.Linked List operations

4.Dynamic memory management

**Project Structure**

1.Each task contains:

         1.Task ID

       2.Task Title

2.Tasks are stored as nodes in a linked list.

**How to Run**

Clone the repository

Open the .cpp file in any C++ compiler

Compile and run the program

Use the menu to manage tasks

**Menu Options:**

Insert Task

1.Display Tasks

2.Update Task

3.Delete Task

4.Exit

**Use Cases:**

Learning linked list operations

Practicing DSA in C++

Simple task management system

Future Enhancements
